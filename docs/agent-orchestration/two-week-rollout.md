# Two-Week Rollout

## Week 1: Foundation

- Day 1: confirm role ownership (`plan/build/verify/release`) and success metrics.
- Day 2: adopt `routing-rules.md` and apply score-based dispatch in team workflow.
- Day 3: align CI gate expectations with verification steps in PRs.
- Day 4: publish prompt templates and run two dry-run tasks end-to-end.
- Day 5: review failed cases and tune escalation thresholds.

## Week 2: Stabilization

- Day 6-7: replay 5-10 recent changes through the new routing policy.
- Day 8: exercise fallback runbook with one simulated CI failure.
- Day 9: track baseline KPIs (success rate, retries, cycle time, cost/task).
- Day 10: lock policy v1 and share team playbook.

## Suggested KPIs

- first-pass success rate
- mean retries per task
- median time-to-merge
- security gate turnaround time
- cost per completed task
